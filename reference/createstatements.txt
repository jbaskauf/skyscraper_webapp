Brief discussion:
Skyscrapers are our main object.
Materials, purposes, cities are all linked to multiple skyscrapers and there is a finite number of each of these types. Putting them in their own tables and linking them to the skyscrapers will be better than including all of the information in a single skyscraper table.
